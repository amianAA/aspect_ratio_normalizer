# Photo aspect-ratio normalizer
This script uses [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to adjust the aspect-ratio of any picture present in the script folder (jpg or raw files), to a defined `REFERENCE_ASPECT_RATIO` (4/3 by default). 

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 (or above)
- Pillow 

## Usage 
It's very simple. Just create a venv to install Pillow, put your pictures in the same folder as the script, and run the script.
